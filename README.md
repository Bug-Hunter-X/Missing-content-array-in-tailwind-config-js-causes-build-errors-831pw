# Missing content array in tailwind.config.js

This repository demonstrates a common error in Tailwind CSS configuration: omitting the `content` array in `tailwind.config.js`. This array is crucial for Tailwind to scan your project's HTML and JavaScript files, identifying and processing the classes you're using.  Failure to include this leads to build errors and unexpected styling issues.

## Bug Description

When you don't specify the `content` array, Tailwind can't find your custom classes and won't apply the styles defined in your Tailwind configuration. This will result in build failures or unexpected rendering behaviors where classes don't appear to be working.

## Solution

To resolve the issue, ensure you include the `content` array in your `tailwind.config.js`, pointing to the directories or files where Tailwind should search for your classes.

The `bug.js` file shows the incorrect config, while `bugSolution.js` demonstrates the correct implementation.
